Use the following template to draft new DAO resolutions.

Refer to the [Diva Staking DAO Community Guidelines](https://github.com/staking-foundation/diva-dao/blob/main/Community-Guidelines.md) for additional context.

# <DAO Vote Title>

## Description

The Description is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

This section is optional.

The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the DIP solves. It should not describe how the DIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious.

## Specification

The Specification section should describe the new feature or DAO resolution.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Additional considerations

Where necessary, sections will be adding considering:

- Backwards Compatibility
- Test Cases
- Reference Implementation

## Security Considerations & Classification

Discuss the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.

Include a risk classification based on Impact, as described in the [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/staking-foundation/diva-dao/blob/main/Community-Guidelines.md)
