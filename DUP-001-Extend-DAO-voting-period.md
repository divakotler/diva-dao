- Proposed on: Aug 7th, 2023
- Proposal: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/proposal/56958626083257221666271982785321134035427569254871851122225553156063961119322

## Description

Currently, Diva Staking DAO has a voting delay of 2 days and a voting period of 3 days.

Discussions were held by the community on whether the voting period should be extended to 5 or 7 days, to increase participation and reduce the risk of proposals going unnoticed during periods like weekends.

- Discord discussion: https://discord.com/channels/1041618287500460083/1133466096763158629
- Forum discussion & temperature check: https://commonwealth.im/divastaking/discussion/12343-voting-periods

As of the time of this post, the temperature check received a total of 27 votes, 66.666% of the votes for extending the voting period to 5 days, 25.925% of the votes proposing 7 days and 7.407% of the votes proposing to keep the current periods without changes.

Therefore, I propose to extend the voting period to 5 days, allowing for a total of 2 days delay + 5 days voting for future proposals.

As a result of this, the community should benefit from higher participation in governance.

## Classification

This is is a Diva Update Proposal (DUP), requiring 75% positive votes, as it aims to update the Diva Staking DAO core infrastructure.

This change affects the Diva DAO Governor settings, modifying voting periods.

## Risk mitigation

It has been verified by deploying a testnet version of Diva DAO on Goerli, which worked as expected: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/kotler-tests/proposal/66307969040438179555392762970769919850214148824220256268845152992830867101671
