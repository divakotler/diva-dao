# Diva Staking DAO INITIAL COMMUNITY GUIDELINES 

## Section 1. Definition and Purpose

The Diva Staking Decentralized Autonomous Organization (the ‘Diva Staking DAO’) is an unincorporated association of individuals, entities, associations and/or other persons or groups of persons holding the DIVA token AND having completed a process referred to as “delegation”. The Diva Staking DAO is not intended to, and shall not be deemed to, be a legal person or have a legal personality separate from the DAO Members. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the DAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.

The Diva Staking DAO purpose is the curation and updating of the public software materials referred to as the Diva Protocol. For the avoidance of doubt the Diva Staking DAO is not intended to administering or managing the Diva Protocol in any manner whatsoever, being its mission limited to making the blockchain interaction commonly known as ‘staking’ more accessible, efficient and resilient by the usage of non-proprietary software.

## Section 2. Governance Tokens

Diva Staking DAO governance tokens (the Governance Tokens) means the effectively delegated tokens associated with the Diva Protocol and referred to in https://github.com/staking-foundation and designated as Delegated DIVA. D-DIVA. D-Tokens, or any other designation the Diva Staking DAO may find appropriate from time to time.

## Section 3. Excluded Tokens 

DIVA Token(s) which have NOT being revocably delegated (either as self delegation or delegation to third parties) through the applicable designated governance smart contract of the Diva Staking DAO are NOT deemed as Diva Staking DAO governance tokens and have no power to submit any kind of DAO proposal, participate in the voting of any kind of DAO proposals.

## Section 4. DAO Resolutions.

In accordance with the token amount thresholds set forth below in Section 5 for the submission of proposals, each Governance Token holder has the right to submit and vote on proposals (a ‘DAO Proposal’) and each proposal validly passed by Governance Token holders and not cancelled by the DAO governance mechanism is to be considered a ‘DAO Resolution’).

## Section 5. DAO Proposals. 

Proposals may be submitted by any Governance Token holder holding at least 1 Million Governance Tokens subject to any applicable threshold and/or any frequency restriction or other parameter so designated by the Diva Staking DAO through the passage of a Diva Improvement Proposal (as defined below).

There are three types of Proposals: 

- DCP - Diva Curation Proposals; means proposals intended to distribute governance power among communities, sealing strategic partnerships, etc. 
- DIP - Diva Improvement Proposals; means proposals aiming to adapt or modify a configurable feature of the Diva Protocol.
- DUP - Diva Update Proposals; means complex proposals aiming to update the Diva Protocol core infrastructure and require some code implementation.  

## Section 6. DAO Proposals Quorum and Thresholds. 

In order for a Proposal to be valid a quorum of at least 10 Million Governance Tokens is required. 

The thresholds initially set for each kind of proposal are as follows, 

- DCP - more than 50% of favourable votes
- DIP - more than 66% of favourable votes
- DUP- more than 75% of favourable votes

## Section 7. DAO Proposals Procedures

### 7.1. Temperature Check - NDP - New Diva Proposals Process

In order for a proposal to be formally considered by the community an off chain process referred to as ‘temperature check’ must be followed.  Its main aim is to properly evaluate if the proposal intended to be submitted counts with enough interest and community support. 

The temperature check is done through the DAO offchain community forums by opening a new thread referring to the term “New Diva Proposal +[subject]”

The thread is intended to provide all necessary information and collect feedback to prepare the formal proposal which would later be submitted for its voting and subsequent approval or rejection.

Any member of the community at large may open a thread in the Diva Forum outlining the proposal which needs to be debated or any suggestion which may be deemed as beneficial to the community at large. 

The title of the thread shall include: NDP and a short description of the proposal 

The NDP shall contain at least the following: 

- Short and concise description of the proposal
- Rationale: why the proposal is necessary and what benefit will bring to the community
- Tentative classification as DCP, DIP and DUP
- A community pool to indicate the flag the level of support the proposal may have.

### 7.2. Proposal submission

Proposals can only be submitted by those which have at least 1M D- DIVA delegated and it implies an on-chain transaction.

Proposals can be submitted at tally.xyz/gov/diva on “create a new proposal”  

The proposal shall include the following structure: 

- Short name of the proposal 
- Definition as DCP, DIP or DUP 
- DCP Proposals shall include a short description of the proposed action to be taken
- DIP Proposals shall include a risk assessment of the proposed implementation of such proposal and the executable code (Tally provides a list of executable functions which can be implemented) 
- DUP Proposals; this shall include a thorough description of the technical features aimed to be implemented, executable code and test cases. 

Any proposal shall include a copyright waver. Further, any code or material included in any proposal shall be open sourced and released to the public domain without any restriction whatsoever.

### 7.3. Proposals Voting Delay

Once the proposal has been created “on-chain” there is a waiting period (voting delay). During that period token holders can still delegate their tokens (either self delegate or delegate to third parties). Such delegation will affect the necessary quorum for a proposal to become valid as only Delegated DIVA tokens are accounted for any governance purpose. 

Initially the voting delay period is being set to 2 days 

### 7.4. Proposal Voting Period

Once the voting delay period has elapsed all the proposals have a predetermined voting period of 3 days upon submission under which any D-DIVA can vote in favour or object 

After such period has elapsed, considering a valid quorum of 10M D-DIVA has been met and the correspondent voting threshold has been exceeded the proposal shall be considered passed and will become a DAO Resolution

## Section 8. DAO Resolutions

### 8.1. Queueing for execution and Cooldown Period

Upon successful confirmation that the corresponding threshold and quorums have been met, an on-chain transaction is required to set the approved DAO Resolution in queue for its execution, starting a Cooldown Period through this transaction.

Initially the Cooldown period is being set as 6 days for DCPs and DIPs while DUPs have a cool down period of 10 days. 

During the Cooldown period an approved DAO Resolution still can be disputed and cancelled (see more below) 

### 8.2 Execution 

Once the Cooldown period has elapsed, anybody can execute the transaction to implement a DAO resolution. As the required functions to effectively implement the desired outcome have been previously registered within the proposal, the execution of said transaction does not alter in any manner the terms of the DAO Resolution. 

## Section 9. Disputes

Any DAO Resolution can be challenged before it is executed due security considerations such as governance attacks or fraudulent code implementation. 

In order to challenge a DAO Resolution a Cancellation Proposal must be submitted by a community participant counting with a governance power delegated of at least 1M D-tokens. 

The Proposal shall clearly specify “Cancellation Proposal” and set clearly and consciously what is the harm prevented by the cancellation and other remedies proposed to avoid further damage to the Diva Protocol and or community. 

In order to be valid a cancellation proposal requires a quorum of at least 10M tokens and more than 50% of favourable votes. 

The execution of said Cancellation Proposal can be fulfilled 2 hours after its approval.
